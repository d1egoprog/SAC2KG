## **Introduction**  
This library is the Python implementation of the Volcano Event Ontology (VEO), enabling users to:  

- Generate RDF graphs compliant with VEO.  
- Validate and extend ontology-based models.  
- Interface with SOSA, TIME, and GEO vocabularies.  
- Simplify integration with machine learning workflows and early warning systems.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Ontology Management**: Load and extend the VEO ontology.  
- **Graph Generation**: Build RDF triples programmatically.  
- **Data Validation**: Ensure compliance with the ontology structure.  
- **Custom Mapping**: Map seismic data to the ontology classes and properties.  

---

## **Installation**  
Install the library from TestPyPI: 

``` bash  
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ sac2kg
```

Alternatively, install the latest version from source:

``` bash  
git clone https://github.com/d1egoprog/sac2kg.git  
cd sac2kg  
pip install .  
```
## Usage

### As a Python Library

1. Download the [SAC](demo/example_trace.sac) (Seismic Analysis Code) or create a JSON file `example_trace.json` in some place of your file system. A [copy](demo/example_trace.json) is uploaded in the demo folder.

``` JSON
 {
    "seismic_network": "US",
    "station": "ANMO",
    "instrument": "Broadband Seismometer",
    "delta": 2.5,
    "axis": 0.75,
    "signal_type": "itime",
    "unit": "m/s",
    "positive_polarity": true,
    "latitude": 34.945,
    "longitude": -106.457,
    "elevation": 1850.0,
    "system_lifetime": "2023-12-15T08:00:00Z",
    "data_points": 10,
    "component": "Z",
    "data": [0.01, 0.12, -0.03, 0.04, -0.08, 0.10, -0.02, 0.03, -0.01, 0.07],
    "event": "Earthquake",
    "energy": 1.2e12,
    "magnitude": 4.5,
    "focal_mechanism": "Strike-slip",
    "source_latitude": 35.200,
    "source_longitude": -105.750,
    "source_elevation": 1500.0,
    "depth": 12.3,
    "alert_level": 2
}
```

2. Copy the code into a Python module file and execute it or intagrate in your solution.

``` Python  
import sac2kg

print('-------Reading a SAC file and create the VEO-KG-------------------')
g1 = sac2kg.read_from_json('example_trace.sac', ontology=False )
sac2kg.graph_store(g1, 'example_sac_kg.ttl', output='ttl')

print('-------Reading a JSON file and create the VEO-KG-------------------')
g2 = sac2kg.read_from_json('example_trace.json', ontology=False )
sac2kg.graph_store(g2, 'example_json_kg.ttl', output='ttl')
```

### Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The library provides a robust Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool located in the [demo/](demo/) folder. This tool simplifies the process of mapping SAC or JSON trace files into Knowledge Graphs following the VEO schema. Whether you are working with single files or entire directories, the CLI provides flexible options for various use cases.

To explore the CLI in action, navigate to the  [demo/](demo/) folder and use the provided script. Below is an overview of its features and an example use case.

``` bash
python -m sac2kg my_trace.sac my_kg
```

### Advanced Usage

- **Custom Ontology Extensions:** Extend the base ontology by adding new classes and properties using the provided ontology builder tools.
- **Integration with Existing RDF Graphs:** Merge the generated RDF graphs with other semantic web datasets.
