## **Introduction**  
This library is the Python implementation of the Volcano Event Ontology (VEO), enabling users to:  

- Generate RDF graphs compliant with VEO.  
- Validate and extend ontology-based models.  
- Interface with SOSA, TIME, and GEO vocabularies.  
- Simplify integration with machine learning workflows and early warning systems.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Ontology Management**: Load and extend the VEO ontology.  
- **Graph Generation**: Build RDF triples programmatically.  
- **Data Validation**: Ensure compliance with the ontology structure.  
- **Custom Mapping**: Map seismic data to the ontology classes and properties.  

---

## **Installation**  
Install the library from PyPI:  
``` bash  
pip install sac2kg
```

Alternatively, install the latest version from source:

``` bash  
git clone https://github.com/d1egoprog/sac2kg.git  
cd sac2kg  
pip install .  
```
## Usage

### Example: Mapping and Exporting Data

``` Python  
from sac2kg import GraphManager  

# Initialize the ontology generator  
veo = GraphManager()  

# Sample data to map
data = {
    "network": "TRZ",
    "station": "CPV",
    "instrument": "Seismometer",
    "latitude": 40.123,
    "longitude": -8.456,
    "elevation": 500,
    "data": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
}

# Map the data to the ontology
rdf_graph = mapper.map_to_ontology(data)

# Export the RDF graph
rdf_graph.serialize("output.ttl", format="turtle")
print("RDF data exported to output.ttl")
```
